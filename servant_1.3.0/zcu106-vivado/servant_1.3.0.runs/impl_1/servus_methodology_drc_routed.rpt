2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock sys_clk_pin is created on an inappropriate pin ibufds/IBUFCTRL_INST/O. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#1 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance servant/rf_ram/memory_reg_0_255_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#2 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance servant/rf_ram/memory_reg_0_255_1_1 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#3 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance servant/rf_ram/memory_reg_256_511_0_0 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-5#4 Warning
Mapped onto distributed RAM because of timing constraints  
The instance servant/rf_ram/memory_reg_256_511_1_1 is implemented as distributed LUT RAM for the following reason: The timing constraints suggest that the chosen mapping will yield a better timing.
Related violations: <none>
